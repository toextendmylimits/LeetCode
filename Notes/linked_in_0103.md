# High frequent questions
## 364. Nested List Weight Sum II
Master one pass/two pass DFS and BFS. Memorize high-level ideas and writ it down.

## 339. Nested List Weight Sum

## 146. LRU Cache
More practice. Got it wrong by self.key = None in constructor of Node  
实现LRU，follow-up是多线程版本的LRU，AI的作用在这里就是search那些不常用的API，最后测试的时候比较tricky

## 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III
Follow up circular array

## 200. Number of Islands
Also more practice. Made mistake when checking boundary of cols 

## 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

## 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
Should have a quick look again

## 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
变种 https://www.hack2hire.com/companies/linkedin/coding-questions/688bc39c3867670cfb89417b/practice?questionId=688bc3a43867670cfb89417c 
## 20. Valid Parentheses
Follow-up can you not use stack?

## 53. Maximum Subarray
## 101. Symmetric Tree

## 205. Isomorphic Strings
Practice again. Made crucial mistake of not upadting char to first index map

## 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
## 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
## 1644. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree II

## 380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)
Practice again

## 605. Can Place Flowers
Just memorize it

# Check later today
## 127. Word Ladder
## 716. Max Stack
## 432. All O`one Data Structure

## 244. Shortest Word Distance II
Just memorize.
Store each word’s positions in a sorted list. For a query, scan the two position lists with two pointers,   
always moving the pointer that points to the smaller index. Track the smallest distance seen.   
Because lists are sorted, this finds the minimum in one pass.  

## 277. Find the Celebrity
Memorize:  
1. bruce force approach.  
2. One pass
I eliminate candidates in one pass:
if A knows B, A can’t be the celebrity, so I keep B.
After one scan, only one candidate remains.
Then I verify that this person knows nobody and everyone knows them.

## 671. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree
## 152. Maximum Product Subarray
## 341. Flatten Nested List Iterator
## 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

# To work on
## 366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree
## 636. Exclusive Time of Functions
## 296. Best Meeting Point
## 721. Accounts Merge
## 1882. Process Tasks Using Servers
## 698. Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets
## 319. Bulb Switcher
