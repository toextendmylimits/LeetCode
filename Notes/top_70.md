## 141. Linked List Cycle
Memorize the code.

Use two pointers: a slow pointer (moves 1 step) and a fast pointer (moves 2 steps).  
If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list (None).  
If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer inside the loop — like a runner lapping another on a track.  
That meeting point proves a cycle exists.  
This runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) extra space.
