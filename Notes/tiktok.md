## 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
I use dynamic programming where dp[i] is the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.  
For each position, I look at all earlier positions with smaller values and extend the best subsequence found so far.  
The answer is the maximum value in dp.  
This runs in O(n²) time and O(n) space.
