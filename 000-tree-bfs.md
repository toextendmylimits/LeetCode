# Tree BFS
## Easy
1. [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal)  
1. [107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii)  
   Do a normal level order traversal and then reverse
1. [637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-of-levels-in-binary-tree)
1. [199. Binary Tree Right Side View](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view)
   Only add the last item of each level to result
1. [103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal)
   Have a flag for zig zag order, and use queue to save each level's result, as inserting at front is O(1) compared to O(n) for list
